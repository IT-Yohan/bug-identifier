# 4. Component-Based Styling System

## Status
Revised

## Context
The current styling implementation is complex for a POC, with aspirations for an atomic design system, intricate token management, and advanced performance optimizations. For a POC, such complexity is not required, and a simpler, consistent styling approach is more appropriate.

## Decision
Adopt a simplified styling system by:
1. Utilizing Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with a basic configuration.
2. Defining a minimal set of design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) in a JSON file.
3. Avoiding over-engineered solutions such as dynamic theme generation and Figma integration.
4. Ensuring basic responsiveness and accessibility.

## Consequences
- Faster development and easier maintenance during the POC phase.
- A simpler design system that can be extended in the future.
- Limited styling customization until further requirements emerge.
