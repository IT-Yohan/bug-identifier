# 2. Error Handling Strategy

## Status
Accepted (Simplified for POC)

## Context
Given the scope of our Proof-of-Concept (POC) application, we've implemented a straightforward error handling approach focused on user experience without the complexity of production-level error management.

## Decision
- Use component-level error handling for API requests
- Provide localized, user-friendly error messages
- Log errors to console for development debugging
- Handle common scenarios (invalid file type, API failures)
- Present clear feedback to users when errors occur

## Consequences
- Appropriate for POC demonstration purposes
- Simple implementation with minimal overhead
- Clear user feedback for common error scenarios
- Would need enhancement for production use
