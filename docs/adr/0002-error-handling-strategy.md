# 2. Unified Error Handling

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Given the scope of our Proof-of-Concept (POC) application, our error handling strategy is intentionally simplified. The current system does not require extensive error taxonomies, resilience patterns, or monitoring integrations that are common in production-grade systems.

## Decision
- Implement a global error boundary to catch all errors.
- Log errors to the console for debugging purposes.
- Display user-friendly error messages that do not expose technical details.
- For 404 (not found) errors, show a customized message informing users that the page was not found.
- Provide a "Try again" option to allow basic error recovery.

## Consequences
- Simplified error handling reduces implementation and maintenance overhead.
- Limited error classification and recovery strategies.
- Not suitable for full-scale production without further enhancements.
