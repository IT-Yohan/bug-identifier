# 3. Legal Pages Implementation

## Status
Revised

## Context
For our Proof-of-Concept (POC) application, we require basic legal pages (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy). The full production requirements, such as secure content management, versioning, dynamic PDF generation, and audit trails, are beyond the scope of the POC.

## Decision
Implement legal pages by:
1. Storing static markdown files in the public/legal directory.
2. Rendering legal content as static pages.
3. Keeping the implementation simple without authentication, versioning, or automated PDF generation.

## Consequences
- Easier and faster implementation.
- Limited flexibility in updating legal content dynamically.
- Suitable for a POC; additional enhancements can be applied for a full production release.
